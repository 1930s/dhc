DHC is a Haskell compiler that produces WebAssembly.

It accepts only a tiny subset of the language.
There is almost no syntax sugar.

Lambdas compile incorrectly. They should be manually lifted instead.

There is no support for the `S` (strings), `Call` and `Qual` language features
declared in `DHC.hs`, which are used by other Dfinity projects.
